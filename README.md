# MeBoard101
## Introduction
[Me Uno Shield](http://www.makeblock.com/me-uno-shield) is a shield of Arduino UNO and Arduino101/Genuino101. It can turn Arduino Pins into Makeblock Rj25 ports.You can connect Arduino101/Genuino101 with Makeblock electronic modules. This shield provides a stable power, so it can drive many servos and motors.

 * Download the library for Arduino101/Genuino101 https://github.com/Makeblock-official/MeBoard101/archive/master.zip
 * Copy the MeBoard101 folder to your arduino default library. Your Arduino library folder should now look like this 
   * (on Windows): ```[x:\Users\XXX\Documents]\Arduino\libraries\MeBoard101\src```
   * (on Mac OSX): ```[\Users\XXX\Documents]\Arduino\libraries\MeBoard101\src```
 * Open Arduino IDE, choose the firmware101 from <em>File Examples MeBoard101</em>.
 * Compile and upload firmware according to your Arduino101/Genuino101 board.
